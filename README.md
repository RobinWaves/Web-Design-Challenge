# Web-Design-Challenge
## Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

This assignment consists of a Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude!  A  visualization dashboard website was created using visualizations created in a past assignment (see python-api-challenge). 

Individual visualization pages for each plot were created along with navagation between them. These pages contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.  There is also a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

* index.html - landing page containing an explanation of the project, sidebar link and preview images of each plot
* comparision.html - contains all of the visualizations on the same page along with a link to them
* data.html - responsive data table containing the data used in the visualizations
* styles.css - cascading style sheet for formatting html files
* cities_to_html.ipynb - juypyter notebook file used to import cities.csv file to output cities.html file

Visualizations:
* MaxTemp.html - plot and descriptive paragraph, sidebar link and preview images of each plot
* Humidity.html - plot and descriptive paragraph,sidebar link and preview images of each plot
* Cloudiness.html - plot and descriptive paragraph, sidebar link and preview images of each plot
